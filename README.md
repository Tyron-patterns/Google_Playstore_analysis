# 📱 Google Play Store – Exploratory Data Analysis

This project explores and analyzes a dataset of mobile applications from the Google Play Store, with a focus on understanding patterns in app pricing, popularity, user behavior, and category trends.

The workflow includes:
- ✅ Data Cleaning  
- 🛠️ Feature Engineering  
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The dataset is cleaned, transformed, and explored to extract meaningful insights and prepare it for possible future use in statistical evaluation or machine learning tasks.

## 📁 Project Structure

The project is organized into three separate Jupyter Notebooks:

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   Handles duplicates, missing values, formatting issues, and type conversions.

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   Creates structured variables from raw data (e.g., standardized versioning, install counts, size in MB).

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Highlights trends in app installs, pricing, reviews, and category distribution using statistics and visualizations.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Data manipulation with **Pandas & NumPy**  
- Data visualization using **Matplotlib & Seaborn**  
- Statistical thinking applied to real-world product data  
- Feature transformation and cleaning logic  
- Reproducible and well-organized Python workflow

## 📌 Notes

This project was developed for **portfolio showcasing** and **learning practice**. Some tasks—especially in the feature engineering section—may go beyond the immediate needs of exploratory analysis to highlight familiarity with different data preparation methods.

⚠️ **Work in Progress:** Some parts of the EDA section are still being developed. While many analyses have already been conducted, not all include formal interpretation of the results yet. Final insights and visual polishing will be added soon.
